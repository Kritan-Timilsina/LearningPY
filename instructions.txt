Close opened folder in VSCode:
Ctrl + K followed by F

Open new empty folder in VSCode with drag and drop

Open lower terminal panel with Ctrl + J

Note: For terminal commands, Mac users must write
python3 instead of python and pip3 instead of pip

(1) Check which python is being used
where python # for Windows users
which python # for Linux and Mac users

(2) Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

(3) Activate the virtual environment
   (this is manual way,
   but easier way is to select with Ctrl+Shift+P)
.venv\Scripts\activate # for Windows
source venv/bin/activate # for Linux and Mac users

deactivate # for deactivation

(4) Check which python is being used again
   (must be within our project folder)
where python # for Windows users
which python # for Linux and Mac users

(5) Install Django (which auto installs dependencies)
pip install Django

(6) Create requirements.txt file to track dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

(7) Start a new django project
   (this creates project folder called home in current folder)
   (also creates manage.py file in current folder)
django-admin startproject home .

Note: NATC means not a terminal command

(7.5) [NATC] Modify settings.py timezone value, change to Asia/Kathmandu which is the same all over Nepal

(8) Check project creation success
   (this also creates a lightweight sqlite database)
python manage.py runserver

(9) Create a new django app
   (keep in mind that both project and app folder created
   are valid python packages due to presence of __init__.py file)
python manage.py startapp pages

(9.5) [NATC] Modify settings.py again to include our new app

(10) Make migrations and run the server again
python manage.py migrate
python manage.py runserver

Next NATC Steps:
- First create a template pages/templates/pages/index.html
- Create a function-based view to render this template called home
- Create a new urls.py file in pages and setup path registering view there
- Include this url configuration in the project urls.py
- Refresh the home page to see the results
